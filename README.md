## Week 1

During the first week of the course, I explored the basics of HTML and developed a solid understanding of its fundamental elements. I learned about semantic elements, which help define the different sections of a web page, making its structure and content more meaningful and accessible. Additionally, I understood the correct way to write HTML code, following best practices and proper syntax. This week gave me valuable insights into various aspects of HTML and established a strong foundation for my web development skills. To reinforce my understanding, I worked on creating a blog post page.
