 web development language used are HTML , CSS and JavaScript
week -1

   During the first week of the course, I explored the basics of HTML and developed a solid understanding of its fundamental elements.
   I learned about semantic elements, which help define the different sections of a web page, making its structure and content more meaningful
   and accessible. Additionally, I understood the correct way to write HTML code, following best practices and proper syntax. This week gave me 
valuable insights into various aspects of HTML and established a strong foundation for my web development skills. To reinforce my understanding.
